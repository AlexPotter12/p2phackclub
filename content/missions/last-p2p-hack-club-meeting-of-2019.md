### 2020 News!

#### Next Meeting Date

Our next meeting is going to be **January 16th, 2019**. If you've gone to this meeting, you are automatically signed up for the club next semester!

**NOTE:** If you are no longer interested in the club, or you are unable to attend next semester, please let us know so that we can accomodate more club members.

#### Sticker Competition!

We need your sticker ideas! The coolest stickers will be printed out for our next meeting, with enough to give out to all of the P2P Hack Club members! You can make a sticker on paper, Google Draw, Photoshop, Illustrator, or send a PNG/JPG file!

We might be able to print every single sticker design that is submitted! 

You are able to submit multiple sticker designs, and the sticker doesn't have to say anything about Hack Club/P2P specifically, although it would be so cool to have a bunch of Hack Club stickers everywhere! =)

**The deadline to submit stickers is December 31st**, so you can make your stickers super awesome before then!

Here is the form to submit:

#### Hackathon Coming Up!

This weekend, The University of Colorado Boulder (CU) is hosting a hackathon! This is an event like a Hack Club, but it lasts for a much longer time! During a hackathon, you can form a team, and finish a programming project during a time limit for prizes!

Local Hack Day is a hackathon happening on **December 7th, 2019**. You should totally come! It is going to be a lot of fun!
